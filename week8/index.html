        <div class="grid-item item8">
            <p>
                My favorite topics were covered in Week 5 & 6 :<h5> Responsive Web design, CSS Grid, Flexbox , Pseudo Selectors and Transitions</h5>  Responsive web design
                is one of the most important skills in web development. There are so many different devices with a wide range of screen sizes and it is a must that your wb pages look
                good on all of them! CSS Grid and Flexbox help make short work of responsiveness. And the Pseudo selectors and transitions are just cool added features.

            <p>The take aways from this first module are:</p>
            <ul><li>Planning is KEY!</li>
                <li>Sketching out a rough design will save hours of design time and headaches</li>

            <p>Each week in this module I gained more knowledge and greater understanding of web development and the chaallenges that come with it.
            This allowed me to begin narrowing down the specific career path I would like to take and what steps I needed to 
            take to get there. I also became more aware of what strngths and weaknesses. Looking forward to next module and the rest of the program.
